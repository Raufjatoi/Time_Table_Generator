### University Timetable Generator in Django – a Full Stack Web Framework in Python

> The project is still under work  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Add env file**:  
> I didn’t add the environment file, so you should create your own. It’s good practice to keep all dependencies isolated within a project-specific environment. You can create one like this:  
> ```bash
> #create env file 
> python -m venv env
> # activate it 
> ./env/scripts/activate
> # and finally after done deactivate 
> deactivate  
> ```

### Tech Stacks:  
- **Django**: Python Web Framework  
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database used in this project  
- **Custom Styles**: Created custom CSS for the styles; I didn’t use Bootstrap or Materialize. However, feel free to rewrite the code using these frameworks if you prefer 😊.
